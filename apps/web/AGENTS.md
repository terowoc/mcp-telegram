# Project instructions

Telegram web app using TypeScript and Teact, a custom React-like UI library. Follow nearby code and the repository's ESLint and Stylelint configurations; the rules below capture project-specific constraints and review feedback.

## Scope and workflow

- Keep changes directly related to the request. Search for existing types, functions, components, and hooks before adding them.
- Use existing dependencies only. If the task requires a new library, stop and explain why.
- Make routine implementation decisions from the code and task context. Ask when ambiguity materially changes the work; continue independent, authorized work meanwhile.
- Only write tests when directly prompted to do so.
- Review the change for the smallest coherent design that satisfies the requirements. Fix substantive findings and repeat until none remain; avoid speculative abstractions, unused exports, and unrelated cleanup.
- Keep responses concise: summarize the result, verification, and any unresolved issue. If deeper debugging needs user involvement, provide concrete steps. Remove temporary debug code when resolved.

## Verification

- After TypeScript changes, run `npm run check:ts`; after SCSS changes, run `npm run check:css`.
- For import-order errors, try `npx eslint --fix <filename>`. If it fails, make one manual attempt, then report the remaining error. Suggest that command for unresolved auto-fixable ESLint errors.
- Keep additional verification proportional to the change. Once relevant checks pass, repeat or broaden them only for new changes, failures, or unresolved concerns.
- For browser verification, reuse `localhost:1234` if running; otherwise run `npm run dev`. If a sandboxed check fails, confirm through the browser or an approved check outside the sandbox before starting another server.
- Do not modify account state (send messages, change settings, etc.) unless directly prompted.

## Code conventions

- Functions and methods start with an imperative verb; `callback` is an exception. Use camelCase for acronyms (`parseJson`, `isUiReady`).
- Boolean names use `is`, `has`, `are` (for plurals), `should`, `can`, or `will`; the argument `force` is an exception.
- Optional boolean arguments and props default to `undefined`. Use a negative prop such as `noAvatar` for opt-out behavior. Preserve intentionally `undefined` or `false` prop values instead of adding defaults.
- Allowed abbreviations: `e` for events, `err` for errors, `cb` for callbacks; single-letter names are allowed in one-line lambdas.
- Hoist reused static constants to module scope with `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Do not inline magic numbers inside functions, except 0 and 1.
- Prefer function declarations, except where arrow functions bind `this`; order functions by call hierarchy, with high-level functions first. Follow the component signature convention below for components.
- Prefer early returns. Check required arguments at the call site instead of making them optional solely to guard inside the callee.
- Cache a pure function's result when using it more than once in the same scope.
- When a value is guaranteed at runtime but TypeScript cannot infer it, use `!` instead of a guard that silently skips work. Avoid unnecessary `as` casts; prefer `satisfies` where appropriate.
- Use `undefined`, not `null`.
- Avoid conditional object spreads: use `{ field: condition ? value : undefined }` so TypeScript checks the field against the target type.
- Comments explain complex logic. Start with a capital letter, wrap code entities in backticks, and omit the trailing period for single-sentence comments; punctuate each sentence in multi-sentence comments.
- Docs and comments assert current behavior in the present tense. Keep bug/change history and comparisons to prior code in Git history. Comparisons with hypothetical alternatives are fine when they explain the current design.

## Teact components

- Import built-in hooks from `src/lib/teact/teact.ts`; do not import `react`. React types are globally available in the `React` namespace.
- Type props on the component parameter instead of using `FC`. Migrate existing `FC` signatures in components you change.
- Use `OwnProps` for parent props and `StateProps` for `withGlobal` props; omit unused types. Put handlers and functions last in prop types.
- If used, `getActions()` is the first statement in the component. Call `useLang()` near the top.
- Prefer `useLastCallback` for stable callbacks with the latest scope. Use `useCallback` when a render function needs memoization.
- Prefer `useFlag` for simple toggles; use `useState` when setting a boolean from another variable. Avoid adding `useEffect` when existing hooks or direct callbacks suffice.
- Wrap components with `memo` when their props can remain stable. Skip wrappers with frequently changing `children` and primitives such as `ListItem`, `Button`, and `MenuItem`.
- Do not pass freshly allocated objects or arrays to memoized components. Use `useMemo` only for loops/expensive work or complex values passed to memoized children.
- Use the shared `Icon` component; available names are in `src/types/icons/index.ts`.

## Global state

- Prefer a component's existing `withGlobal`. If it is absent and a simple selector suffices, use `useSelector`. Use `getGlobal` only inside callbacks for one-off, non-reactive reads.
- Annotate `withGlobal`'s mapping function with `Complete<StateProps>` so every state prop is returned. Wrap connected components in `memo` when their props can remain stable.
- Selectors are pure and preserve object/array identity. Avoid loops and new objects or arrays in `withGlobal` mappings. For list computations, use `useShallowSelector` and perform the computation in `useMemo`.
- Put state selection/update logic longer than one line in the appropriate selector/reducer under `src/global/`.
- Update state through actions: return state from synchronous handlers or use `setGlobal`. Sync handlers return `ActionReturnType`; async handlers return `Promise<void>`. Actions under `src/global/actions/ui/` are synchronous.
- Update `src/global/types/actions.ts` when adding or removing an action.
- Pass `tabId` when calling an action or selector that accepts it. UI component calls may omit it because they receive it automatically.
- Store serializable data in global state: primitives and plain objects/arrays containing them, not class instances or functions.
- When adding a required `GlobalState` section, add its initialization to the `migrateCache` path in `src/global/cache.ts`. Changes to cached types need a migration; verify compatibility with state cached by the current `master` branch, including nested objects.

## Rendering and animation

Teact and Fasterdom separate DOM measurement from mutation. The frame order is effects, requested measures, JSX rendering, layout effects, requested mutations, then forced reflow measures/mutations.

| Context | Measure DOM | Mutate DOM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useLayoutEffect` | No | Yes |
| `useLayout` (deprecated) | Yes | No |
| Event handlers | Yes | Schedule with `requestMutation` |
| `requestMeasure` | Yes | No |
| `requestMutation` | No | Yes |

- For a measurement-dependent write, read inside `requestMeasure` and schedule the write with `requestMutation`. Use `requestForcedReflow` only as a last resort for synchronous measure/mutate work. See `src/lib/fasterdom/fasterdom.ts`.
- Prefer signals for frequent updates that do not need component renders, such as typing, caret position, and animation state. Signal setters notify subscribers without rendering; `useDerivedState` turns signal values into render state. Use `useStateRef` to read current state without adding dependencies.
- Reuse existing signal and scheduling hooks. `useSyncEffect` runs during render; `useLayoutEffectWithPrevDeps` runs in the layout-effect phase. Respect the corresponding DOM phase rules.
- Protect animation performance, especially in `Message`, `Chat`, and `Sticker`. Use `beginHeavyAnimation` to pause non-critical updates during heavy animations and `onFullyIdle` for work that can wait until animations and browser activity are idle.

## Styles

- Use camelCase classes in SCSS modules, import them as `styles`, and combine classes with `src/util/buildClassName.ts`.
- Add styles to the stylesheet already imported by the component. Extract styles to files; use inline styles only for values that need them.
- Teact's `style` prop accepts strings, not objects. Use a template literal for dynamic styles, e.g. ``style={`transform: translateX(${value}%)`}``.
- Prefer `rem` measurements (`N px = N / 16 rem`), with exceptions only when needed.
- Give each styled element a class. Avoid broad, complex, and tag-based selectors; nest only for meaningful relationships such as `.parentModifier .child`.
- Use existing font-weight variables, such as `var(--font-weight-medium)` and `var(--font-weight-semibold)`; never numeric weights, `bold`, or custom values.

## Localization

- Use `lang()` for all user-facing text. In components, get it from `useLang()`.
- Before adding a key, search existing translations and the [Translation Platform](https://translations.telegram.org/) for matching wording. Add new keys to `src/assets/localization/fallback.strings`, then run `npm run lang:ts`.
- Keys use PascalCase without dots, short context prefixes, and roughly fewer than 30 characters. Plurals need `_one` and `_other` forms.
- Replacements are the second argument; plural selection is an option in the third. Include replacements when the plural string has variables: `lang('PluralKey', { count }, { pluralValue: count })`.
- Use `{ withNodes: true }` for JSX replacements and add `withMarkdown: true` for Markdown. Reuse `lang.number`, `lang.region`, and conjunction/disjunction helpers where appropriate.
- Outside components, prefer translation objects supported by actions, such as `showNotification({ key: 'LangKey' })`, over calling `getTranslationFn()`.

## Telegram API

- GramJS runs in a web worker; UI and global state use plain `Api*` objects from `src/api/types`.
- Read the TL schema in `src/lib/gramjs/tl/static/api.tl`; do not edit it. Add needed method names to `src/lib/gramjs/tl/static/api.json` and run `npm run gramjs:tl` to regenerate `src/lib/gramjs/tl/api.d.ts` and schema modules.
- Implement methods under `src/api/gramjs/methods/` using destructured parameter objects and `invokeRequest(new GramJs.namespace.MethodName(...))`. Name TL `get*` fetchers `fetch*`.
- Convert results using `apiBuilders` (`buildApi*`) and inputs using `gramjsBuilders` (`buildInput*`). Return `undefined` when `invokeRequest` returns `undefined`.
- Global actions call methods through `callApi` and check for `undefined` before updating state. Pass full `ApiPeer`, `ApiChat`, or `ApiUser` objects across this boundary; do not add separate `id`/`accessHash` method parameters. Extract fields for `buildInput*` inside the GramJS method.
- Server updates enter through `src/api/gramjs/updates/mtpUpdateHandler.ts` and merge through `src/global/actions/apiUpdaters/`; update types live in `src/api/types/updates.ts`.

## Commits and PRs

- Use `[Tag] Component / Area: Imperative description` for commit messages and PR titles. Capitalize the area and description's first word; omit trailing periods and semicolons.
- Optional tags: `[Refactoring]`, `[Perf]`, `[Size]`, `[Dev]`, `[SEO]`, `[CI]`, `[Security]`.
- Prefer plain text, with backticks for programmatic names. Separate multiple tasks with semicolons; start each sentence with a capital letter.
- Add `Closes #<issue_number>` to the PR description when addressing an issue.
